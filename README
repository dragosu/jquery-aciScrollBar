aciScrollBar - Cross browser skinnable scrollbars with jQuery.

Features of aciScrollBar include:

- dynamic content updates - the scrollbars will update by itself when you change content;

- you can scroll content by keyboard, mouse, mouse wheel and on touch devices - available if optional plugins are included;

- you can resize the scrollbar area - with the included built-in resize control;

- configurable bar position, bar visibility, button order and button visibility - without changing the theme;

- initialization of a scrollbar control inside another one - keyboard scrolling will work with the focused scrollbar;

- you can set default options - use them across all your scrollbars;
