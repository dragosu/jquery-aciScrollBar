aciScrollBar - Cross browser skinnable scrollbars with jQuery.

Support for mouse wheel and touch events is added by using additional jQuery plugins.

Simple usage:

$().ready(function(){
    
    $('.scroll').aciScrollBar();
    
});

where 'scroll' is the CSS class of the element that we want to apply custom scrollbars.

Using initialization options you can change the bars and the button order and the bar position with ease, you can hide the buttons or the entire bar if you want.

The bars will be show or not depending on the CSS rules of the scroll area (the 'overflow' property) and the content of the scroll area.

You can choose from a few included themes or design your own. The CSS file must be loaded before you can set the skin because
the bar and the button size is computed from the CSS rules.

If you want to interact with the control just trigger one of the available events. A built-in resize control is included and you can offer your users the choice to resize the scroll area.

The scrollbars will be auto-updated when the content changes. You can load content with Ajax or objects like images and the visual appearance of the scrollbars will be updated at a interval without your intervention.

Check the examples to learn how to use it. I have included the optional plugins to make it easy for you :)
